# node-dymo-printer2

A library / module to print labels from Node.js. Pure javascript cross-platform with no platform specific dependencies. There is no need to install
the DYMO SDK or DYMO Webservices.

Developed for the DYMO LabelWriter 450, but might also work for other models.

This is a fork of the original [node-dymo-printer](https://github.com/kozmoz/node-dymo-printer) library.
